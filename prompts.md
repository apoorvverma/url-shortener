There was only 1 prompt I used, to check if there was anything I am missing after I noted all the issues to be fixed. Surprisingly, there were indeed a couple of good ones the AI came up with that I had missed.

Prompt: (With the index.html and server.js files attached)
```I have attached a simple Node.js application with an Express.js API and SQLite DB that allows users to shorten URLs and track them.

Now list any issues you find with this application. Please provide a description of all the issues you find and your reasoning behind it. ```
